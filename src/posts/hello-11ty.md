And so, a new voice emerges from the void.

I'm not one for introductions, so I'll keep it brief: I'm Trivaxy.

I started my programming journey back in 2016 by creating mods for Terraria. Ever since then, I took an interest in writing code, building things, and so on. Today, I'm fluent in all sorts of different languages and tools - but be warned: I don't guarantee quality of knowledge!

There's all sorts of different fields I'm interested in. Languages and compilers, AI/ML (no, not just LLMs or GenAI), game development... probably other stuff I can't name off the top of my head.

I'm a fresh university graduate with a bachelor's in Software Engineering. I would've taken Computer Science, but a title with "engineer" sounds way cooler.

And... that's it. I like writing, and I like yapping, so I thought starting a blog would've been quite nice. I'll post whatever comes to mind here, and I'll *try* to keep it interesting.

Thanks for stopping by.
